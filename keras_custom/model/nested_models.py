    Create a nested model that extracts a sub-model from a given model, starting from the specified input and output layers.

    This function allows you to define a sub-model that performs forward propagation starting from the `layer_in`

        layer_out: The output layer of the sub-model. The function will extract the layer operation associated
                           with this layer.
        layer_in: The input layer to the sub-model. This layer defines where the forward pass will begin.
